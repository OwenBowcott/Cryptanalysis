# Cryptanalysis
This project focuses on cryptanalysis using two decryption techniques: brute force and letter frequency attacks. In the brute force attack, every possible key combination within a defined range is tried to decrypt encrypted messages until readable text is produced. The letter frequency attack leverages statistical characteristics of letter usage by comparing the frequency of characters in encrypted messages with those in standard English texts from novels like Les Mis√©rables and War and Peace. This method involves combining all messages from a collection into a single file, calculating and sorting character frequencies, and then deducing the most probable key used for encryption.
